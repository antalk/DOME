## About ##

Dome is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game for the MSX 2 , based on the game Dune II from Westwood.
Initial development started around 1997/ 1998 by the group Paragon MSX and several alpha and beta versions were released to the MSX community. However development halted around 1999 (With probably a third of the game finished)

After more than 20 years we are releasing the original sources to the public and maybe try to re-create a building project which will be forever in progress ;)

## Sources ##

The original sources which i retreived from my MSX are in the folder 'orgsources'. These were retrieved using Compass 1.2 converting them from ASM to ASC files.

The rebuild sources (Using Sjasm and eclipse) are in the rebuild folder.

'binaries' contain the output of the assembled sources, and 'disk' the disk image.

## Building ##
